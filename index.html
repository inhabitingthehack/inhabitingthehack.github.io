        <h3>Welcome</h3>

	<p><em>Inhabiting the Hack</em> is a collaborative research
	project examining the notions of innovation and creativity
	ingrained in digital culture. We will work with arts
	organisations in developing alternative styles of hack events,
	often informed by traditional arts activities such as
	residencies and retreats. The hacks all privilege diversity,
	collaboration and reflection, and are positioned in
	alternative and complementary disciplines and histories,
	provide a critical perspective on current practice.

	  <ul>
	    <li>What relationships between innovation, practice,
	      imagination and material does the hackathon uncover?
	      How do maker cultures reorder these relationships, and
	      to what extent does enhanced tangibility and liveness in
	      digital interfaces interfere with or promote
	      innovation?</li>
	    <li>Where does innovation need to be located in the design
	      process (is it located in the design process?) in order
	      to be captured, exploited, made meaningful? Is
	      innovation as it is produced here, necessarily a good
	      thing?</li>
	    <li>What future does the hackathon imagine? What
	      potentials for innovation and creativity are
	      suggested?</li>
	  </ul>
