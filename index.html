        <h3>Welcome</h3>

	<p><em>Inhabiting the Hack</em> is a collaborative research
	project examining the notions of innovation and creativity
	ingrained in digital culture. We will work with arts
	organisations in developing alternative styles of hack events,
	often informed by traditional arts activities such as
	residencies and retreats. The hacks all privilege diversity,
	collaboration and reflection, and are positioned in
	alternative and complementary disciplines and histories,
	provide a critical perspective on current practice.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>What relationships between innovation, practice,
	      imagination and material does the hackathon uncover?
	      How do maker cultures reorder these relationships, and
	      to what extent does enhanced tangibility and liveness in
	      digital interfaces interfere with or promote
	      innovation?</li>
	    <li>Where does innovation need to be located in the design
	      process (is it located in the design process?) in order
	      to be captured, exploited, made meaningful? Is
	      innovation as it is produced here, necessarily a good
	      thing?</li>
	    <li>What future does the hackathon imagine? What
	      potentials for innovation and creativity are
	      suggested?</li>
	  </ul>

	<h3>Hacks completed</h3>
	<p><strong>Wrekshop</strong>. A
	  "<a href="http://www.zprod.org/zwp/wrekshop/">Wrekshop</a>"
	  lead by performance artist Paul Granjon, taking redundant
	  technology apart, and reconstructing it as something new.
	  </p><p>
	  Paul Granjon is an electronic artist who makes robots and
	  other machines for performances and installations. Paul is
	  interested in the co-evolution of humans and machines. A
	  fervent advocate of creative techno making fun, he believes
	  that people need to get their hands dirty with technology,
	  understand that it is crucial to consume less of it and know
	  more about how it works. He disseminates his ideas and
	  unique upcycling techniques in Wrekshops that involve
	  people, electronic waste, digital fabrication and
	  open-source electronics. He is currently working on a song
	  on electricity, to be performed off-grid.  In collaboration
	  with <a href="http://access-space.org/">Access Space</a> as
	  well as <a href="http://www.zprod.org/zwp/">Paul
