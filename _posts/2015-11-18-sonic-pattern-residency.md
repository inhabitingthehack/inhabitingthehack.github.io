title: Sonic Pattern Group Residency
date: 2015-11-18

---

[Sonic Pattern and the Textility of Code](http://sonicpattern.com/) is
a series of events (symposia, performances, exhibitions) curated by
Karen Gaskill (who until 2016 lead the Innovation strand of the Crafts
Council) and Alex McLean. Through these events we bring people working
variously with threads, sound and code together, for discussion and
practice focussing on the cultural-technological role of pattern in
their work.

As part of the Inhabiting the Hack series, we joined with the AHRC
[Weaving Codes, Coding Weaves](http://kairotic.org) project and Crafts
Council to fund a symposium, evening of performances and group
residency.

## Group residency


The Sonic Pattern group residency took place several months after the
earlier symposium and evening of performances, bringing together
emerging artists to explore the theme of the series. It was a three
day residency, from 18-20th November 2015, with the artists being
given an opportunity to explore work on pattern in sound, textiles and
code, or go off on a tangent.

The resident artists were:

* [Magalena Halay](http://magdalenahalay.com/)
* [Toni Buckby](http://tonibuckby.com/)
* [Nora o Murchu](http://www.noraomurchu.com/)
* [Sean Cotterill](http://seancotterill.com/)

Supported by (broadly speaking) more established established artists:

* [Alex McLean](http://slab.org)
* [David Littler](http://davidlittler.tumblr.com/)
* [Karen Gaskill](https://about.me/karengaskill)
* [Sarah Williams](http://sewilliams.me.uk/)

... as well as John Moseley (fabrication lab manager) and Jake Harries
  (creative director) of [Access Space](http://access-space.org/), who
  were hosting the residency and helping the artists access their
  facilities of a laser cutter, 3d printer and cnc machine, and
  general workshop facilities, among other things.

There were no particular expectations about what would be achieved
over the 3 days, the idea was just to explore ideas. It's was group
residency, but no particular collaborations were forced.

The residency began with a half-day Tablet weaving workshop with Sarah
Williams.

This brought focus on the structure of fabric, generated from complex
interferences between simple elements, and how analogous aspects of
pattern can be explored through code and/or sound.

Despite the lack of pressure, the participants produced a range of
outcomes, detailed below.

## Nora o Murchu - Cat++

Cat++ is a visual live-coding language based on feline behaviour.

The project has already gained attention online, including via an
excellent
[blog post on the popular Creators Project blog](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/cat-visual-coding-language). The source code is [available on github](https://github.com/n0rette/catplusplus).

## Toni Buckby and Sean Cotterill

Toni and Sean ended up collaborating on using sensors to capture the
movements of sewing embroidery, and then visualising and sonifying
that data.

Sean has described what they got up to
[in detail on his blog](https://seancotterill.com/2015/11/26/sonic-pattern-residency-access-space/).

## Magdalena Halay

Magda explored the potention of code to map between forms, in the
below case transforming glitched images into laser etching.

## Group performance

We closed the residency with a group performance, unfortunately the
main recording failed but thankfully Jon Harrison was in the audience
and captured it on his phone:

The fully improvised performance included Nora VJing with her new live
coding system, Magda sampling and processing sounds, Toni sewing
embroidery patterns generated from her own movements (creating a
feedback loop), Sean live coding sonification of Toni's movements,
David playing a folk tune on a music box with live sonic manipulation
in software, and Alex live coding in his TidalCycles system.
