Rewriting the Hack was a Women Only Hackathon exploring the theme,
Industrial and Post Industrial North East. The two day event examined
the Hackathon format as a site for producing collaborative,
interdisciplinary art strategies and explored issues surrounding
diversity in an increasingly popular model of creative
production. Participants created with archival materials relating to
the NE regions industrial heritage and current, open data sets, which
represent our post industrial present. Challenging perceptions that
Hackaton events as well as histories of our industrial past and our
scientific and technological present are male dominated.

Rewriting the Hack is curated and produced by digital artist Shelly
Knotts and curator Suzy O'Hara with support from Victoria
Bradbury. The event was part of Inhabiting the Hack a Communities and
Culture Network project.

Rewriting the Hack was funded by RCUK Digital Economy. Materials and
equipment kindly provided by our wonderful partners Attaya Projects
and House of Objects. Many thanks The Core, Science Central for
hosting us. Tyne and Wear Museums, Mining Institute and Newcastle City
Library for supporting us through their expertise and access to online
