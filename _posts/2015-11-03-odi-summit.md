Creative Labs took place at the Open Data Institute (ODI) Summit in
London, showcasing the diversity of open, digital arts and
performance. It brought together a wide range of people in a room full
of installations, demos, hacking, and headphone performances, with
people from the ODI summit able to drift in and out through the day,
to listen, observe, and take part. Here's a taste of what went on:

----

[Chris Kiefer](http://luuma.net/) and
[Alice Eldrige](http://www.ecila.org/) spent the day hacking some
electronics and code, to make small microcontrollers listen to the
environment and communicate to each other with sound.

[Andrew Wilson](http://foldup.org/) took the opportunity to do some
research within the lab and ODI summit, exploring the processes by
which open data might create socially valuable outcomes, reflecting on
the
[Who owns my neighbourhood?](http://whoownsmyneighbourhood.org.uk/)
open data project he did with Kirklees Council in 2010. You can find
[his notes on github](https://github.com/foldup-cic/odi-summit-creative-lab).

----

[Joanne Armitage](http://joannnne.github.io/) demonstrated *Enclosed*, which "... explores the directionality
of sound through an augmented tactile experience. A fixed media audio
file is spatialised in real-time. A haptic grid of 16 motors attached
to a chair renders the tactile element, producing vibrations that
follow the trajectory of the accompanying sound."

[Tom Mudd](http://www.tommudd.co.uk/) demonstrated *CONTROL*, "an interactive installation
exploring the relationships between artists, music, and digital
musical systems. It brings together the work of a wide range of
artists and musicians into a single dial that the delegates could come
and interact with."

The [Digital Media Labs](http://www.digitalmedialabs.org/) team
(Benedict Philips, Glenn Boulter and David Lynch) noted that "... ODI
creative lab turned out to be a great opportunity for digital media
labs to exhibit their touring exhibition which presents artists
activities and information about the experience and process of the
labs. The team took the opportunity to talk to many people engaged in
creative and digital industries, spreading the word about their
approach to creative professional development for creative
practitioners from a diversity of practices who engage with digital
technologies in their practice.  They were extremely encouraged by the
level of enquiry shown by the conference delegates and entered into
some useful and often passionate debates about the importance of free
space to imagine new ideas and processes. It's was also a great
opportunity to spread the word about their first book ‘digital media
labs 2014’ soon to be followed by a second book about the 2015 digital
media labs, coming summer 2016."
